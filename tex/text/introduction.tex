\section*{Release v1.0.0}

First, thank you for using this template!
For the better use experience please follow these rules:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Write only one \textbf{sentence each line}.
	This will help with the automate merging procedure and with the error tracking.
	\item When you add new sections to the document, please edit only the \texttt{main.tex} file.
	\item All your text go in the \texttt{text} folder.
	\item All your images go in the \texttt{img} folder.
	\item If you want to edit the template, explore the \texttt{template} folder.
	\item To change the language of the document, change the first line of the file \texttt{main.txt}.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Edit the first page}

In the current release, the first page is a simple image file (\texttt{img/wallpaper.jpg}) with the following size:
\begin{itemize}
	\item height: 297mm (2790pixel)
	\item width: 210mm (2100pixel)
\end{itemize}
Since the document is an \textbf{A4 paper} format this image fit the whole document space.
To avoid problems, you have to replace this image with another maintaining the same size.
In a future release this is going to change.
