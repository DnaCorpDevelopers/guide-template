# Template used for guides

This is a template written in LaTeX that can be used to create a printable version of a guide. If you want to see the results, check [this](https://corsairhaven.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/cronologia_.pdf) PDF document with the *Chronology of X* in Italian.

### Use the template

Simply, edit the information in the *main.tex* file, put your text files in the *text* folder and the images in the *img* folder. More information can be found in the *readme.pdf*.

If you want to edit the template, try the *template* folder.

Please, **do not remove** the only credits line at the end of the document.

### Future developments

* Better first page in the **LaTeX** document
* **phpbb** support files (used in the Egosoft forum)
* **xhtml** support files (why not?)
* **Steam guides** support files
